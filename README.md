# LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS — LT<sub>E</sub>X+ Language Server

LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS (LT<sub>E</sub>X+ Language Server) implements a language server according to the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and provides grammar and spelling errors in markup documents (L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, Markdown, etc.). The documents are checked with [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/).

Typically, you start the language server (either locally or remotely), you send the language server your L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X or Markdown document, and it will respond with a list of the grammar and spelling errors in it. To use LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS in this way, you have to use a language client (usually an editor or an extension of the editor) that communicates with LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS according to the LSP.

However, it is also possible to supply LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS paths to files and directories to be checked as command-line arguments. In this mode, LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS will print the results to standard output, and no language client is necessary.

The reference language client of LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS is the [LT<sub>E</sub>X+ extension for Visual Studio Code (vscode-ltex-plus)](https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/), whose development LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS follows closely and vice versa.

Find more information (how to install, how to use, etc.) at the [website of LT<sub>E</sub>X](https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/).

Until version 16.0.0, Julian Valentin developed LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS as [LT<sub>E</sub>X LS](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls).
LT<sub>E</sub>X LS is a fork of the abandoned [languagetool-languageserver](https://github.com/adamvoss/languagetool-languageserver) by Adam Voss<sup>†</sup>.
This language server would not have been possible without the work of Adam Voss<sup>†</sup> and Julian Valentin.
